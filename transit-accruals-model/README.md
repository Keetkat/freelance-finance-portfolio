# Accruals Forecasting Model for Public Transit Budgeting

This project simulates a real-world scenario involving fiscal year-end closeout for a public transit agency. The model uses Excel to identify active purchase orders (POs) with unspent balances, estimate accruals, and support FY26 financial planning. The dataset has been anonymized and converted to dummy data for portfolio purposes.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Excel file is currently being finalized and will be uploaded shortly. This repository is being prepared to showcase the methodology and documentation in advance.

## üßæ Use Case
> **Context**: At the end of each fiscal year, agencies must forecast accruals for services or goods received but not yet invoiced.  
> **Challenge**: Accurately flag active encumbrances, assess remaining balances, and identify funds unlikely to be spent in FY25.  
> **Solution**: Build a dynamic Excel model that automates key metrics and supports budget reconciliation.

## üîß Tools & Techniques
- **Excel PivotTables** for departmental summarization and trend analysis
- **Calculated columns** to dynamically assess remaining balances and flag accrual-eligible POs
- **Data validation & filters** for clean manipulation and reporting
- **Dashboard tab** using Excel charts and tables for quick executive insights
- **Scenario analysis** embedded into formulas to test different accrual assumptions

## üìä Project Deliverables
- Dummy dataset containing:
  - Cost Center allocations
  - PO encumbered vs. paid values
  - Accrual eligibility logic
- A clean summary dashboard with:
  - Total POs
  - Total FY25 encumbrances vs. payments
  - Estimated carryforward amounts for FY26
- PivotTables to drill into accruals by department and PO status

## ‚úÖ Key Skills Demonstrated
- Financial modeling and accrual logic design
- Budget forecasting and variance analysis
- Data transformation for non-technical end users
- Documentation and dashboard presentation for stakeholders
- Readiness for integration with Power Query or automation workflows

## üìÅ Files Included (Coming Soon)
- `Accruals_Portfolio_Template.xlsx`: Excel workbook with anonymized financial data, summary tab, and pivot-ready dataset
